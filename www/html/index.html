    <h2>What is XSServer?</h2>
    <p>
      XSServer is an easy-to-use web API for serverless
      cross site scripting. This API is a response
      to seeing cross site scripting challenges in cybersecurity
      CTFs, but having no quick and easy serverless tools. I hope
      this tool helps people in similar situations as well as people
      who want easy cross site scripting for other ethical
      reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a very young project whose interface is not stable yet.
      Don't make applications you expect to use without changing or you expect other
      people to use which involve XSServer.
    </p>
    <h2>Quick How-To</h2>
<pre>
(curl -d '{"key": "deadbeef"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -X POST 'http://www.xsserver.org/poll' | base64 -d &amp;)
curl -d 'Hello, World' -H 'Content-Type: application/octet-stream' -X POST 'http://www.xsserver.org/message?key=deadbeef'</pre>
    <p>
      The output from the above commands should echo back "Hello, World" in the command line (albeit in a weird way).
      They also must be done fairly quickly, as the endpoint uses long polling.
    </p>
    <p> 
      There will be more endpoints which include Websockets and Server-Sent Events.
      The object sent to such endpoints may also have optional fields. What those fields are
      is to be determined.
